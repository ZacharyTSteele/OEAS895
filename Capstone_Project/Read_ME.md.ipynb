    "Stable isotope analysis (SIA) is a powerful tool that has been a staple of the fields of oceanography, geochemistry, and forensic sciences. Recently, the application of SIA has expanded to other fields such as ecology and animal biology. However, the incorporation of SIA to ecology and animal biology is often limited to carbon and nitrogen isotopes. In addition, many researchers in the fields of ecology and animal biology choose to send their samples to other institutions for analysis instead of completing their analyses in-house because of the expenses and logistics related to traditional isotope analysis. The development of new instrumentation such as cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy provide a potential solution to these setbacks. In particular, CRDS is an affordable alternative to the long-standing traditional reliance on isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). CRDS instruments, such as the Picarro L2140-i, provide high-precision measurements of hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopes in a fraction of the time required for IRMS analysis, and CRDS instruments possess automated functionality, allowing for a less labor-intensive process compared to IRMS.\n",

    "   Stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen (measured as δ17O, δ18O, and δ2H) can provide information related to the sources of environmental water intake and to the animal’s body water pool. Most hydrogen and oxygen analyses use distilled blood plasma or serum samples, but under the right circumstances (e.g., a trained animal in captivity) distilled saliva and urine samples can be collected as well. A central premise for all these methods is that water is critical to animal biology. Most terrestrial animals are ~60-70% water by mass, and this body water comes from a combination of environmental sources and endogenous processes (e.g., newly-synthesized metabolic water, a byproduct of metabolic pathways.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   The code stored in this repository (file name “Capstone_Project”) is designed to help expand the use of stable isotope analysis via CRDS to the fields of ecology and animal biology. While CRDS instruments such as the Picarro L2140-i are user-friendly water isotope analyzers, the concepts related to SIA are still daunting and may be intimidating for many ecologists or animal biologists who may consider incorporating this type of instrumentation into their lab. Many researchers continue to rely on shipping their water or plasma samples to outside institutions for analysis due to this obstacle. The purpose of this repository is to provide simple and efficient code to demonstrate the ease with which a researcher can correct and finalize data from a CRDS water analyzer instrument for publication. For example, while the raw datasheet exported from a CRDS instrument like the Picarro L2140-i provides data related to >25 variables, the variables of interest are as follows:\n",
    "   \n",
    "1)\tδ17O (in the code as ‘d(17_16)Mean’ for raw values and ‘d17O_amended’ for corrected) \n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tδ18O (in the code as ‘d(18_16)Mean’ for raw values and ‘d18O_amended’ for corrected)\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tΔ17O (calculated from δ17O and δ18O; in the code as ‘E17_Mean’ for raw values and ‘E17O_amended’ for corrected)\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tδ2H [deuterium;2H] (in the code as ‘d(D_H)Mean’ for raw values)\n",
    "\n",
    "5)\taverage water concentration (in the code as ‘H2O_Mean)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the code provided in this repository generates an exportable datasheet with just these variables of interest.\n",
    "This repository contains six datasets generated from my lab: 3 datasets related to ‘standards runs’ and 3 datasets related to ‘analysis runs’. Each standards run dataset is composed of ~600 measurements, while analysis run is composed of 300-450 measurements. The standards run datasets involve measurements of internationally accepted water standards (VSMOW [Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water] and SLAP [Standard Light Antarctic Precipitation Water], along with other in-house waters. The standards run is designed as a template so that isotope values of the waters corrected by measurements of VSMOW and SLAP during this run can be established for the next set of analysis runs which also contain samples from different animal plasma with unknown values. For example, a completed 3-day standards run will influence the next 2-months of analysis runs. At the end of these two months, another standards run will be conducted to establish new values for in-house waters and the cycle repeats. Once a standards run is completed, the raw data should be exported and then imported into python using the provided. The code then builds a correction equation by comparing the known and measured values of the VSMOW and SLAP for δ17O and δ18O. The individual correction equations are then applied to the raw δ17O and δ18O values of each water included in the standards run, allowing for generation of corrected values for δ17O, δ18O, and Δ17O. The corrected values are then compared to known and established in-house values to ensure that the run was successful. The code provided should effectively cycle through a standards run, produce comparable isotope values to the known and in-house established values, and then these corrected, measured values can be used to successfully inform proceeding analysis runs that use in-house standards (such as USGS47 and USGS50 [United States Geological Survey]) to correct values instead of VSMOW and SLAP (since these waters are expensive and only available in small volumes; see an example of an analysis run via Table 1). \n",
    "\tTo provide support for this, I have provided three raw datasheets for both standards runs and analysis runs. Each standards run datasheet is paired with an analysis run datasheet (e.g., ‘StandardsRun_1’ is compatible with ‘AnalysisRun_1’). Each pairing should demonstrate the following: \n",
    "    \n",
    "1)\tThat generating a correction equation from VSMOW and SLAP measurements during standards runs should generate: \n",
    "a.\tδ17O values within 0.15‰ (per mi) of the known/established value\n",
    "b.\tδ18O values within 0.3‰ of the known/established value\n",
    "c.\tΔ17O values within 0.015‰ of the known/established value\n",
    "\n",
    "2)\tThat the finalized values from the standards run should be incorporated into the data environment such that it can be used to influence the proceeding analysis run\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tThat generating a correction equation from in-house water standards (in the provided code these are ‘USGS47’ and ‘USGS50’) with values established from the preceding standards run should generate: \n",
